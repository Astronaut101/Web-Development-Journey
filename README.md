# Web-Development-Journey

Based from Flavio Copes the JS Bootcamp 

I will be updating the repo from time-to-time along with my code files, notes, and significant progress that I have made along the way. This would give folks an idea about what Flavio Copes' JavaScript Bootcamp and its curriculum is all about.   

Cheers and stay safe out there! And as always, never stop learning!
