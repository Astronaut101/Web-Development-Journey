# Web-Development-Journey

Good morning/Good afternoon/Good evening to everyone wherever you around the world who are visiting my Web-Development-Journey repository! I am currently attending a JavaScript Bootcamp that is being officiated by Flavio Copes, and currently on my week 2 of the bootcamp discussing HTML, the networking basics, and foundations of the web.
I am working with the Data Management and Data Analytics team in an IT Company here in the Philippines for almost 2 years now, and I would want to continue learning more about web development since it is really fascinating, fun, and with a good mix of frustration and "why does it take me so long to realize this?" kind of moments.

With that in mind, I would love seeing myself in becoming a Front End Web Developer, while also I am working towards in becoming a Professional Data Engineer for Google Cloud as my very soon-to-be role within the company that I am working with.
I am so happy that I have finally found my two ultimate passions that brings me ultimate joy and fulfillment in life; being able to work with Big data and learn AI/ML Solutions for Big data, and as well as seeing myself creating beautiful, interactive, and awesome user-experience kind of websites. 

Cheers! And as always, never stop learning!
