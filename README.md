# Web-Development-Journey

Good morning/Good afternoon/Good evening to everyone wherever you are around the world, welcome to my Web-Development-Journey! I am currently attending a JavaScript Bootcamp that is being officiated by Flavio Copes, and currently on my week 2 of the bootcamp discussing HTML, the networking basics, and foundations of the web.
I am working with the Data Management and Data Analytics team in an IT Company here in the Philippines for almost 2 years now, and I would want to continue learning more about web development since it is really fascinating, fun, and with a good mix of frustration and "why does it take me so long to figure this out?" kind of moments.

With that in mind, I would love seeing myself in becoming a Front End Web Developer, while I am also working towards becoming a Professional Data Engineer for Google Cloud as my very soon-to-be role within the company that I am working with.
I am so happy that I have finally found my two ultimate passions that brings me ultimate joy and fulfillment in life; being able to work with Big data and learn AI/ML Solutions for Big data, and as well as seeing myself creating beautiful, interactive, and awesome user-experience kind of websites. 

I will be updating the repo from time-to-time along with my code files, notes, and significant progress that I have made along the way. This would give folks an idea about what Flavio Copes' JavaScript Bootcamp and its curriculum is all about.   

Cheers and stay safe out there! And as always, never stop learning!
