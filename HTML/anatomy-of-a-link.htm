        <h1>The Anatomy of a Link</h1>
        <p>
            With that in mind, I would love seeing myself in becoming a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Front-end_web_developer" title="The best resource for learning web development! And it's free!!" target="_blank">Front End Web Developer</a>, while I am also working towards becoming a <a href ="https://cloud.google.com/certification/data-engineer" title="GCP Professional Data Engineer" target="_blank">Professional Data Engineer for Google Cloud</a> as my very soon-to-be role within the company that I am working with. 
            I am so happy that I have finally found my two ultimate passions that brings me ultimate joy and fulfillment in life; being able to work with Big data and learn AI/ML Solutions for Big data, and as well as seeing myself creating <strong>beautiful</strong>, <strong>interactive</strong>, and <strong>awesome</strong> user-experience kind of websites.
