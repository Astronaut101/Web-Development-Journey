<!-- Use a single <h1> per page -- this is the top level heading, and all others sit below this in the hierarchy. -->
<!-- Of the six heading levels available, you should aim to use no more than three per page, unless you feel it is necessary. -->

<!-- In HTML we use the <em> (emphasis) element to mark up such instances. As well as making the document more interesting to read, -->  
<!-- these are recognized by screen readers and spoken out in a different tone of voice. Browsers style this as italic by default, -->
<!-- but you shouldn't use this tag purely to get italic styling. To do that, you'd use a <span> element and some CSS, or perhaps an <i> element. -->

<h1>Important notice</h1>

<p>On <strong>Sunday January 9th 2010</strong>, a gang of <em>goths</em> were
spotted stealing <strong>several garden gnomes</strong> from a
shopping center in downtown <strong>Milwaukee</strong>. They were
all wearing <em>green jumpsuits</em> and <em>silly hats</em>, and
seemed to be having a whale of a time. If anyone
has <strong>any</strong> information about this incident, please
contact the police <strong>now.</strong></p>
