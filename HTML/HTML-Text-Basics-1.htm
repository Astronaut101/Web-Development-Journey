        <h1><em>Basic HTML Animals</em></h1>
        <p>This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.</p>
        
        <h2>The Llama</h2>
        <p>
            Our Llama is a big of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.
        </p>
            
        <h2>The Anaconda</h2>
        <p>
            The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.
