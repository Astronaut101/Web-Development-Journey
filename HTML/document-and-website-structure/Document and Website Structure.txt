Document and Website Structure
- Basic Sections of a Document:
1. Header: 
- Usually a big strip across the top with a big heading, logo, and perhaps a tagline.
- This usually stays the same from one webpage to another.
- <head>

2. Navigation bar:
- Many web designers consider the navigation bar to be part of the header rather an individual component, but that's not a requirement.
- Having the navigation bar and header separate is better for accessibility, as screen readers can read the two features better if they are separate.
- <nav>

3. Main content:
- A big area in the center that contains most of the unique content of a given webpage, for example, the video you want to watch, or the main story that you're reading, or the map you want to view, or the news headlines, etc.
- One part of the website that definitely will vary from page to page!
- <main> - can be separated or described with the <article>, <div>, <section>

4. Sidebar:
- Some peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc.
- Contextual to what is contained in the main content 
- <aside> - often placed inside <main>

5. Footer:
- A strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print, copyright notices, or contact info.
- <footer>

- Respecting semantics and use the right element for the right job.
- In a website, visuals don't tell the whole story.
- Using color and font size to draw sighted users' attention to the most useful parts of the content, like the navigation menu and related links.
- Mark up sections of content based on their functionality
