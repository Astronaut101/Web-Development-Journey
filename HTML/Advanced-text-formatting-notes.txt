Representing Computer code:
- There are a number of elements available for marking up computer code using HTML:
- <code>: For marking up generic pieces of computer code
- <pre>: For retaining whitespace (generally code blocks) -- if you use indentation or excess whitespace inside your text, browsers will ignore it 
and you will not see it on your rendered page If you wrap the text in <pre></pre> tags however, your whitespace will be rendered identically to how you see it 
in your text editor.
- <var>: For specifically marking up variable names 
- <kbd>: For marking up keyboard (and other types of) input entered into the computer.
- <samp>: For marking up the output of a computer program.

Marking up times and dates:
- <time datetime="2016-01-20">20 January 2016</time>
